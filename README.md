This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with extensive datasets. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `FlatListSolution.js` presents an optimized solution using techniques like `ItemSeparatorComponent`, `keyExtractor`, and potentially `React.memo` or `useMemo` for enhanced performance.  The README provides a detailed explanation of the problem and the implemented solutions.
